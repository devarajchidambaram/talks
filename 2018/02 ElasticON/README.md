- **Location:** San Francisco, CA, USA

## Abstract

Identifying, debugging, and fixing Node.js production performance issues
is difficult. Learn about Node.js instrumentation and how Elastic APM
can help. See how to improve error monitoring and how to automatically
instrument incoming HTTP requests, database queries, etc.

We'll also cover more advanced topics like how to minimize
instrumentation overhead, how to add valuable metadata to the collected
metrics to ease debugging, and how to add custom watchers to instrument
any part of your codebase.
